			<h3>Lyrics</h3>

				[Intro]
				"All I want to say is that
				They don't really care about us"
				("Don't worry what people say, we know the truth")
				"All I want to say is that
				They don't really care about us"
				("Enough is enough of this garbage!")
				("Okay, alright, alright, alright")
				"All I want to say is that
				They don't really care about us"
				*overlapping voices*
				<br>
				[Verse 1]
				Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
				Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
				In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
				Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				<br>
				[Verse 2]
				Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
				Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
				*** me, sue me, everybody do me
				Kick me, **** me, don't you, "Black or white" me
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				<br>
				[Post-Chorus]
				And tell me, what has become of my life?
				I have a wife and two children who love me
				I am a victim of police brutality now
				I'm tired of being the victim of hate
				You're ripping me off my pride, oh, for God's sake
				I look to Heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free
				<br>
				[Verse 3]
				Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
				Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
				In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
				Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				[Post-Chorus]
				And tell me, what has become of my rights?
				Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
				Your proclamation promised me free liberty now
				I'm tired of being the victim of shame (Ooh)
				They're throwing me in a class with a bad name (Ooh)
				I can't believe this is the land from which I came (Ooh)
				<br>
				[Bridge]
				You know, I really do hate to say it
				The government don't wanna see
				But if Roosevelt was livin'
				He wouldn't let this be, no, no
				<br>
				[Verse 4]
				Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
				Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
				Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
				Hit me, kick me, you can never get me
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				[Guitar Solo]
				<br>
				[Bridge]
				Some things in life
				They just don't wanna see
				But if Martin Luther was livin'
				He wouldn't let this be
				No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
				<br>
				[Verse 5]
				Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
				Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation (Hoo-hoo)
				In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food (Hoo-hoo)
				Kick me, **** me, don't you wrong or right me (We're deep in fire)
				<br>
				[Chorus]
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				We're deep in the fire (Hoo-hoo)
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us
				I'm here to remind you (Hoo-hoo)
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us (Hee)
				Don't you sit back and watch the beatin'
				<br>
				[Outro]
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about—, hoo-hoo
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about—, hoo-hoo
				All I wanna say is that
				They don't really care about us, hee-hee-hee
				Hee-hee, hoo-hoo
