				<br>
				[Verse 1]<br>
				Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad<br>
				Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation<br>
				In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food<br>
				Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 2]<br>
				Beat me, hate me, you can never break me<br>
				Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me<br>
				*** me, sue me, everybody do me<br>
				Kick me, **** me, don't you, "Black or white" me<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				<br>
				[Post-Chorus]<br>
				And tell me, what has become of my life?<br>
				I have a wife and two children who love me<br>
				I am a victim of police brutality now<br>
				I'm tired of being the victim of hate<br>
				You're ripping me off my pride, oh, for God's sake<br>
				I look to Heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 3]<br>
				Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad<br>
				Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation<br>
				In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food<br>
				Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				<br>
				[Post-Chorus]<br>
				And tell me, what has become of my rights?<br>
				Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?<br>
				Your proclamation promised me free liberty now<br>
				I'm tired of being the victim of shame (Ooh)<br>
				They're throwing me in a class with a bad name (Ooh)<br>
				I can't believe this is the land from which I came (Ooh)<br>
				<br>
				[Bridge]<br>
				You know, I really do hate to say it<br>
				The government don't wanna see<br>
				But if Roosevelt was livin'<br>
				He wouldn't let this be, no, no<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 4]<br>
				Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad<br>
				Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation<br>
				Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me<br>
				Hit me, kick me, you can never get me<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				[Guitar Solo]<br>
				<br>
				[Bridge]<br>
				Some things in life<br>
				They just don't wanna see<br>
				But if Martin Luther was livin'<br>
				He wouldn't let this be<br>
				No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 5]<br>
				Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad<br>
				Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation (Hoo-hoo)<br>
				In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food (Hoo-hoo)<br>
				Kick me, **** me, don't you wrong or right me (We're deep in fire)<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus]<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				We're deep in the fire (Hoo-hoo)<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us<br>
				I'm here to remind you (Hoo-hoo)<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us (Hee)<br>
				Don't you sit back and watch the beatin'<br>
				<br>
				[Outro]<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about—, hoo-hoo<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about—, hoo-hoo<br>
				All I wanna say is that<br>
				They don't really care about us, hee-hee-hee<br>
				Hee-hee, hoo-hoo<br>
				<br>
				[Instrumental Outro]
